            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For his Books let them be few or none, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as are prohibited, leſt upon ſuſpition he be ſearched, (as they are at every Gate in <hi>Italy</hi>) be may bring himſelf into danger: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the more caution, let the Notes of his Obſervations be taken in Ciphers or Characters; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that he be alwayes ready to give a fained interpretation. And for his money, let him carry no <pb n="347" facs="tcp:65607:183"/> more with him than will defray his charge unto the next place he is to have his Bill payd; and let him be wary he ſhew not any quantity at any time about him, ſince Thieves have commonly their Spies in all Innes, to enquire after the conditions of Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let him alſo before he go, learn ſome knowledge in the Art of <hi>Coſmography,</hi> for if he be ignorant of that, he will not know where he is, nor which foot to ſet forward: And alſo if he deſire to learn the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of each Kingdom, (that is in moſt uſe in his own Countrey) let him reſort to thoſe places where the beſt Language is ſpoken; thoſe are, <hi>Leipzich</hi> in <hi>Germany, Orleance</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. For his Obſervations, when he cometh into each Kingdom, let him obſerve the fruitfulneſs of each Countrey, the Commodity and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wherewith each Countrey aboundeth and is adorn'd: Let him obſerve the policy of each State, and therein the Courts of each King or
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65607:184"/> Prince, with the Courtiers, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, Offices and Fees: Let him alſo obſerve the traffick of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and the Commodity they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out, and moſt want, with their Havens, Roads for Ships, and the value of Coyn in each Countrey, and the ſeveral currant Pieces.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the obſervation of any City, if the Traveller may without ſuſpition, let him climbe up one of the higheſt Steeples, where having taken the ſituation of the City, he may at his coming to his Inne, draw the form of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let the Traveller take theſe Precepts along with him: If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a journey to any place, let him take the ſeaſonableſt time of the year, and fitteſt time to travel, which is <hi>Spring</hi> and
<hi>Autumn;</hi> and he ſhall do well to go to cold Climes in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hot Climes in Winter: And if the journey he takes be long, let him not acquaint, no not his Companions nor Friends in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the furtheſt end thereof, but rather from City to City, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <pb n="349" facs="tcp:65607:184"/> he intends to go no further; and inſtead of a Companion, let him have alwayes ſuch Books as may fitly accord with his travels, which he may carry without danger.</p>
            <p>Let him alſo when he comes to any City, enquire for the beſt Inne, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo at right in <hi>Italy,</hi> for he may take a ſhort Dinner at any Inne in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo he lodge ſafe at night. In all Innes, eſpecially in ſuſpected places, let him bolt or lock his Chamber-door; let him take heed of his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow; and let him have alwayes his Sword by his ſide, or his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; let him lay his Purſe under his Pillow, but alwayes folded with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or ſomething he firſt uſeth in the morning.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Before he takes any journey, if it be in the morning, let him eat a ſmall Breakfaſt, that ill ſmells may not offend him; and let him dine ſparingly, leſt his after-noons motion hinder his digeſtion; but let him ſup freely. The ſeaſon of the year and nature of the Clime is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected <pb n="350" facs="tcp:65607:185"/> in Diet; in cold Regions let him take hot comfortable things; and in Summer and hot Regions, let him take ſuch things as will cool the Blood; it is dangerous to drink when his Body is heated, unleſs he firſt make water and waſh his mouth; and when he is heated, let him not ſuddenly expoſe himſelf to cold. In the Inne let him have a care to dry his Feet or his Neck if he be wet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and it is not amiſs if he hath the skill.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Likewiſe I adviſe a Traveller to be ſo wary whereever he comes, not to venture on any new thing, till the example of another give him confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Let him reprove nothing in another Mans Houſe, much leſs in a Commonwealth; in which kind it is not amiſs to ſeem dumb, or tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd, ſo he diligently imploy his Eyes and Ears to obſerve all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things. Let him be courteous to all, eſpecially to his Hoſte, the Children, and his fellow-ſo journers in the Houſe; but in all actions let baſeneſs be ſhunned, and decency <pb n="351" facs="tcp:65607:185"/> embraced: If he apply himſelf to the cuſtome of thoſe amongſt whom he lives, he ſhall gain their loves. And as he ought to be humble with decency, and without baſeneſs, ſo in <hi>Germany</hi> he ſhall do well to ſeem, though not to be proud, where they will take a Man to be of baſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he be too courteous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And as a Traveller ought to have a ſlow tongue, and his mind locked up, ſo let him have a clear and chearfull countenance; let him ſpeak ſparingly, and ſeldom ſpeak of his own Commonwealth, or private Eſtate, or good qualities; and let him take this for a general Rule, that nothing doth more preſerve a Traveller out of dangers, or ſooner deliver him in danger, than a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſcreet uſe of his tongue; let him ſhun a talkative companion, or not ſeem to hear their queſtions; let him not enquire after the ſecrets of Religion, nor deſire to be preſent at thoſe Rites. Alſo I adviſe a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to avoid all combats or ſingle
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65607:186"/> Duels, eſpecially in <hi>Italy;</hi> but if it be ſo that he muſt needs adventure his Body, let him provide means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand how to eſcape after victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To conclude, theſe things are very requiſite in a Traveller; the Eye of a Hawk, (to ſee afar off) the Ears of an Aſs, (to hear the leaſt whiſpering) the Face of an Ape, (to be ready to laugh in ſoothing) the Mouth of a Hog, (to eat what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſet before him) the Back of a Camel, (to bear burthens patiently) the Leg of a Hart, (to fly from all dangers) and a full Purſe, to defray all charges liberally.</p>
